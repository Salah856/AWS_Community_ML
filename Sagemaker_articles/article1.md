# Amazon SageMaker

SageMaker makes the life of a data scientist much easier by providing services that you can use to prepare data, build models, test them, and then deploy them into production environments. It provides most of the common algorithms for building your machine learning models, and if you want to make any custom model not supported by SageMaker, then it has a facility to do so by using a bring-your-own container service. It also provides a distributed training option that can make your models run faster, as compared to a single-node run.


Amazon SageMaker comes with following features:

• SageMaker Studio
This is an application where you can build, train, validate, process,
and deploy the models. It’s a single place to do everything.

• SageMaker Ground Truth
This is used to create a labeled dataset.

• Studio Notebooks
This is one of the latest features of SageMaker that includes the
single sign-on feature, faster startup time, and one-click file
sharing.

• Preprocessing
This is used for analyzing and exploring data. It does feature
engineering and transformation of data, as well as all the other
things required to prepare the data for machine learning.
