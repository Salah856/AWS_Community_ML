# Exploring the Blazing Text Algorithm

The blazing text algorithm is a highly optimized version of the word2vec algorithm that allows faster training and inference and supports distributed training as well. Once the vectors are generated using this algorithm, we can use them for different tasks such as text classification, summarization, translation, etc. It supports two architectures, similar to that of word2vec.

• Skip gram architecture
• Continuous bag of words architecture
