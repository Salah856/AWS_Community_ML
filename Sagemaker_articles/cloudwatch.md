# Using CloudWatch with SageMaker

In this part, we will explore CloudWatch functionality in AWS in detail. Specifically, we will look at two components of CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch
Metrics, that we will use a lot while using SageMaker.


## Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a service provided by Amazon that tracks the resource activities of AWS and provides metrics related to it. It also stores the logs that are provided by every resource used.

Through these logs and metrics, a user can explore the performance of an AWS resource being used and what can be done to improve it.
