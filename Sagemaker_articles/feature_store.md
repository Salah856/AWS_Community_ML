# Build accurate ML training datasets using point-in-time queries with Amazon SageMaker Feature Store and Apache Spark 


GoDaddy is the world’s largest services platform for entrepreneurs around the globe, empowering their worldwide community of over 20 million customers—and entrepreneurs everywhere—by giving them all the help and tools they need to grow online. GoDaddy needs a robust, validated, and customizable ML feature management solution, and has chosen Amazon SageMaker Feature Store to manage thousands of features across dozens of feature groups with unique data pipelines and update schedules. Feature Store lets GoDaddy use point-in-time queries to support accurate training and deployment of machine learning (ML) models, covering everything from personalizing content, to preventing fraud, to helping customers find the perfect domain name.


Feature Store lets you define groups of features, use batch ingestion and streaming ingestion, retrieve features with as low as single-digit millisecond latency for highly accurate online predictions, and extract point-in-time correct datasets for training. Instead of building and maintaining these infrastructure capabilities, you get a fully managed service that scales as your data grows, enables feature sharing across teams, and lets data scientists focus on building great ML-driven products for game-changing business use cases. Teams can now deliver robust features and reuse them in a variety of models that may be built by different teams.
