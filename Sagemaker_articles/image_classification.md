# Exploring the Image Classification Algorithm

SageMaker’s image classification algorithm is based upon a special convolutional neural network architecture called a ResNet. Before looking at the application of this algorithm, let’s first explore and understand the ResNet architecture used for image classification.


### ResNet

A ResNet is an architecture that is based on the framework of convolutional neural networks and used for problem statements such as image classification. To understand a ResNet, we must first look at the operation of convolutional neural networks.
