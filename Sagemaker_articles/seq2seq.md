# Exploring the SeqToSeq Algorithm

Amazonâ€™s sequence-to-sequence algorithm is based upon recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and an encoder-decoder architecture to understand the context more efficiently. The next section is a brief overview of the RNN and encoder-decoder architectures.


## Recurrent Neural Networks

When we deal with sequential data or time-based data, it becomes necessary to remember a few things from the past and understand how it can be used to predict the outcome. This is not possible with using normal artificial neural networks or convolutional neural networks. Therefore, a new architecture called RNN is used whenever we deal with sequential data.
