# Dealing with Kafka with Go 

In this article, you will learn how to write and read JSON records using Kafka. Its name was inspired by the author Franz Kafka, because Kafka software is optimized for writing. Kafka is written in Scala and Java. It was originally developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation back in 2011. Kafka's design was influenced by transaction logs.

The main advantage of Kafka is that it can be used to store lots of data fast, which might interest you when you have to work with huge amounts of real-time data. However, its disadvantage is that in order to maintain that speed, the data is read-only and stored in a naive way.
